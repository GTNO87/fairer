fairer blocks commercial manipulation at the DNS level, across every app on your phone.

Most tracking protection stops ads. fairer targets the infrastructure companies use to charge you more based on who you are.

When you open a shopping app, dozens of companies you've never heard of are contacted in milliseconds. 
Criteo builds a profile to enable dynamic pricing. 
Amplitude optimises what price to show you. 
Data brokers sell your purchasing history to retailers. 
Fairer intercepts these requests before they leave your device.

WHAT GETS BLOCKED

telemetry via community-maintained blocklists from Hagezi and EasyPrivacy.
