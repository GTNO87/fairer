#
# These services change the price you see in real time based on who they think
# you are — your device, your location, how long you've been browsing, whether
# you've visited before, and what they guess your budget is. They are why two
# people buying the same flight, hotel room, or supermarket delivery slot at the
# same moment can pay completely different prices. The goal is to extract the
# maximum amount each individual customer is willing to pay.
